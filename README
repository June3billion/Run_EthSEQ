    This script identifies the sample's ethnicity based on the input sample's VCF file.
        EthSEQ package was used for ethnicity identification.
        This script converts the input VCF file to the EthSEQ-compatible VCF file.
        PLINK2 was used to convert the input VCF file, by leaving only GT information of Information column.
   
    Note:
        The current version was constructed by using 1KGP data
        The current version assumes input VCF's kit is IDT
        Required: (Prepared with config file)
            PLINK2 (The version used for develop: v2.00a3LM )
            Rscript with EthSEQ installed (The versions used for develop: R = 4.1.1, EthSEQ = 2.1.4)
